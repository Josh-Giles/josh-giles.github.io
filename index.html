                              Hi, I’m <span class="highlightText">Josh</span> and I'm a <span class="highlightText">software development apprentice from Swindon</span>. I use modern CSS
                              techniques
                              such as flexbox to create responsive websites. <span class="highlightText">As i come from an e-commerce development
                              background i have a focus on building clear and concise user experiences</span> to guide users
                              through
                              systems. I have a passion for web development and enjoy all aspects of it from bug fixes
                              all the
                              way to building new pages. <span class="highlightText">I have worked as a web developer for 1 year</span> but my passion for
                              building solutions with computers started early when I began to build python scripts to
                              perform
                              simple tasks and as time went on I found out about web development and discovered an
                              interest in
                              that.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                              <span class="highlightText">I currently work for T-Shirt Studio</span> as a part of the team who <span class="highlightText">maintain and develop the
                              main
                              e-commerce website and an administration website</span> which allow other staff members to update
                              the
                              products on our website. I work in both projects which means i have developed for and
                              worked in
                              MVC as well as a windows form based environments. As a result i have <span class="highlightText">extensive knowledge</span>
                              of <span class="highlightText">HTML
                              with Razor</span> as well as <span class="highlightText">XSLT and working with the output of XMLs.</span>
                        </p>

                  <h2 class="sectionHeader--Blue">TECHNOLOGIES I ENJOY</h2>

                  <p class="sectionText sectionText--padding">
                        I really enjoy using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with jQuery to create modern sleek front end
                        layouts. I am aiming to master these technologies and then go on to master the more modern
                        frontend libraries as well such as Angular and React. As i’m sure you can tell from this
                        website, I personally really like dark backgrounds with bold contrasting colours on top.
                        <br/>
