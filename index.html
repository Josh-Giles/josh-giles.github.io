                              Hi, Iâ€™m Josh and I'm a software development apprentice from Swindon. I use modern CSS
                              techniques
                              such as flexbox to create responsive websites. As i come from an e-commerce development
                              background i have a focus on building clear and concise user experiences to guide users
                              through
                              systems. I have a passion for web development and enjoy all aspects of it from bug fixes
                              all the
                              way to building new pages. I have worked as a web developer for 1 year but my passion for
                              building solutions with computers started early when I began to build python scripts to
                              perform
                              simple tasks and as time went on I found out about web development and discovered an
                              interest in
                              that.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                              I currently work for T-Shirt Studio as a part of the team who maintain and develop the
                              main
                              e-commerce website and an administration website which allow other staff members to update
                              the
                              products on our website. I work in both projects which means i have developed for and
                              worked in
                              MVC as well as a windows form based environments. As a result i have extensive knowledge
                              of HTML
                              with Razor as well as XSLT and working with the output of XMLs
                        </p>
