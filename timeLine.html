                              I attended school at nova hreod academy with an aspiration to actively pursue a career in
                              computer science. At this time I didnâ€™t know exactly what I wanted to do with in computer
                              science however, I already knew that I enjoyed programming as I had began making small
                              games in python and gradually began adding visual elements to them with the TKinter
                              module. I also knew that communication skills would be vital in any computer science based
                              role so I decided to develop these skills by volunteering for a prefect role so that I
                              could help organise events and communicate with other students within the school in order
                              to organise everything from promotional events at the end of year prom. This helped me to
                              build soft skills which i believe are highly beneficial in my carrer today. In 2017 my 
                              time at Nova Hreod Academy was drawing to a close and I am proud to say that I was presented with an award for

                              Whilsts studying at Nova Hreod Academy I decided that I would like to do some work experience
                              related to my field of interest. I was able to find a placement at the Nationwide Headquarters and was
                              able to get my school to agree to give me a week away from school for this placement. Whilst working for
                              Nationwide I had the opportunity to debug issues with system and even implement some patches into there
                              system which ran in VB.net. I really enjoyed this work palcement as it gave me my first glimpse into the
                              reality of programming and from here on out my primary goal was to work towards finding a software 
                              development role.

                              After graduating from Nova Hreod Academy i decided to continue my learning by doing a BTEC
                              in software development at New college Swindon. During my time here I completed multiple
                              assignments ranging from Cybersecurity and social media marketing all the way to Human
                              computer interaction and project management. Whilst studying at new college I had a role
                              in proactively helping other students with software development and programming as i have
                              always enjoyed mentoring others and handing down what i know.

                              This was my part time job whilst I was studying at school and college. This job initially
                              entailed helping members of the public
                              with purchasing decisions related to motorcycle accesories and protective clothing. As
                              time went on I took on additional responsibilities
                              such as aftersales support and even took a course so that I was certified to provide
                              support and sales for a cutting edge air bag system.
                              I really enjoyed this job as it enabled me to explore my interest in motorcycling while
                              also helping to build up my soft skills such as
                              communication and organisation.
