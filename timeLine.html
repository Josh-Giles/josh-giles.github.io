                              After leaving college I obtained an apprenticeship placement with T-Shirt Studio and I am

                              been an amazing opportunity and continues to provide me with the real life software
                              development experience which I have wanted ever since I started studying Computer Science.

                              accessories and protective clothing. However, as time went on I <span class="highlightText">took on additional

                              Whilsts studying at Nova Hreod Academy I decided that I would like to do some work
                              experience related to computing as I knew this was my main field of interest. I was able
                              to <span class="highlightText">find a placement at the Nationwide Headquarters in the Special Investigations
                              Technology department</span> and was able to get my school to agree to give me a week away from
                              school for this placement.

                              work placement as it gave me my first glimpse into the reality of programming in a
                              workplace and from here on out it was my primary to work towards finding a software

                              I attended school at nova hreod academy with an<span class="highlightText">aspiration to actively pursue a career in

                              I also <span class="highlightText">knew that communication skills would be vital</span> in any computer science based role so
                              I <span class="highlightText">decided to develop these skills by volunteering for a prefect role</span> so that I could help
                              organise events and communicate with other students within the school in order to organise
                              everything from promotional events to the end of year prom. This <span class="highlightText">helped me to build soft
